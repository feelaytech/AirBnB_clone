# AirBnB clone - The console

## About
In this project issued as part of the Software Engineering coursework at ALX Holberton, we were introduced to the steps of building a web application.

`The console` is the first step towards building our first full web application: `The AirBnB clone`. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration etc.

Each task here is linked and will enable us to perform the following tasks:

- put in place a parent class `BaseModel` to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of our future instances.
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: `Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file`
- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Amenity`, `Place` and `Review`) that inherit from `BaseModel`.
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

## Getting started on the console
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - Operating system required.
